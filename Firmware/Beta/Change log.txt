-Introduced alternative to fuel gauge ic way of remaining state of charge estimation, together with fixes of fuel gauge estimation.
	-By default fuel gauge ic is used, and if it is not present or in faulty state, RSoC estimation is calculated directly by mcu.
	-Battery profiles are extended with battery parameters used in RSoC estimation (battery chemistry, open circuit voltage, internal impedance).
	-Introduced possibility to force direct mcu way of estimation by configuration command.
-Battery temperature measurement fixes.
-Added possibility to configure IO2 as digital input wake-up interrupt, enabling peripheral attached to P3 header to wake-up Raspberry Pi.
-Rpi reset after update fix
-Added alternative wakeup via Rpi SCL (GPIO3) if run pin is not connected via pogo pin.
