# PiJuice Remote Camera

This project uses the PiJuice HAT and official Raspberry Pi camera module to create a complete remote camera system. Alternatively, it can be used in-conjunction with the PoE HAT for a complete power and backup power solution to keep you camera up and monitoring 24/7. The software for this project is provided by motioneye OS, which allows you to setup the camera module as a CCTV monitor with motion sensing and recording.
